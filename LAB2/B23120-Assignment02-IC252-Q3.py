# Question 3:
# Consider a well-shuffled deck of n cards, labelled 1 through n. You flip over the cards one
# by one, saying the numbers 1 through n as you do so. You win the game if, at some point, the number
# you say aloud is the same as the number on the card being flipped over (for example, if the 7th card in
# the deck has the label 7). What is the probability of winning? What should be the strategy for choosing
# n to maximize your win probability? Show the same using appropriate visualizations. Take n â‰¥ 2
